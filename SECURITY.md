# Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any software hosted under the
`CloudSecurityAlliance` GitHub organization, please report it through
**GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting (PVR)**:

1. Go to the **Security** tab of the affected repository
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability

GitHub accounts are free. This is the only method for reporting vulnerabilities
in CSA software on GitHub.

## Why Private Vulnerability Reporting

We use GitHub's built-in Private Vulnerability Reporting because it provides a
standardized, integrated workflow for receiving, triaging, and publishing security
advisories. CSA uses the GitHub-recommended security configuration with no
customizations applied.

## What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected versions or components (if known)
- Impact assessment (if known)
- Any proof-of-concept code

## What to Expect

- CSA will acknowledge and triage your report
- Our default is to publish advisories openly and quickly — we treat public
  disclosure as the norm, not the exception. Advisories will only remain private
  temporarily if there is a specific reason to delay
- GitHub automatically credits your GitHub account on the published advisory
- CSA is a nonprofit — we do not offer bug bounties

## Scope

This policy covers all software and services hosted under the `CloudSecurityAlliance`
GitHub organization.

For security issues related to CSA web properties (e.g., cloudsecurityalliance.org)
or other non-GitHub concerns, see CSA's
[security.txt](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/.well-known/security.txt)
(RFC 9116).

## Safe Harbor

CSA supports responsible security research. If you act in good faith and follow
this policy, CSA will not pursue legal action against you.
